###Refactor

Web development and design, like many other disciplines, is an iterative process. Improving readability, reducing complexity make code easier to work with and maintain. Similary design of the web app is also an iterative process, if you are not a professional ui/ux designer. 

Start out with a template you like, refactor it to your needs. Use other sites for inspirations. Make it work on mobile, even as a basic level - especially important if you want to engage more users.

Use a build system like gulp/grunt/webpack to automate your workflow and package your code. 

Get comfortable using and creating modular code. 

Learn how to build your workflow with NodeJS, npm

New Javascript standards (ES6) are out and getting implemented in majority of browsers. Use these. 

Some JS concepts you need to have understanding of - callbacks, closures, asynchronous, functional programming, modules, promises

Test in different browsers. Use emulators built into browsers to test at different screen sizes.

Learn how to use developer tools built into browsers

Build for modern browsers. Don't support IE 8 and 9 (or 10 if you can get away with it) :-)

Learn the new css features - e.g. flexbox. Flexbox support is good across browsers.
